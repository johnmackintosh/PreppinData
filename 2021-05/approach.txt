This line in the instructions
'Be careful not to lose any attendees from the training sessions!' set me off in the wrong direction originally
I saw other people posting solutions where they were looking at training dates  and grouping by client, email contacts etc.

You don't need to do that..

- get the latest 'from date' by client (max date)

- create a lookup table - all rows where from date = max date (by client)
Then take the unique values from this table = 527 rows.
That's your lookup table


- Do a full join of this table back to the main table, on 'client'

- You can either try and update non matches in the client id, account manager and from date columns
OR
- I chose to delete the original from date, client id and account manager, then rename the lookup columns to the original names
(so, if you had 'max date' in your lookup table, this is now 'from date'

- Take the unique values from the resulting joined table
(make sure the columns are in the correct order (data.table moves things around a bit))

You should have 13528 rows.

I checked my outputs with the provided expected results looking for any differences (setdiff in dplyr parlance, fsettdiff,  anti_join in SQL)
You should return nothing, because everything matches :)
